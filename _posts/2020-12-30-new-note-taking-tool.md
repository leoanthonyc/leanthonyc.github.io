title: New note-taking tool
layout: post

It took me three days to research and experiment with different note-taking apps ([Roam](https://roamresearch.com), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io), etc) and methods ([Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method), [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/))

I settled with Obsidian for the following reasons:

1. It is private since data is saved in your local filesystem, not in the cloud nor in Obsidian's servers
2. It is free

Whenever I am in the market for new products or tools, I always check if they respect their users' privacy. If they do, I will gladly pay to use their product as long as the price is reasonable. Bonus if they give [Parity Purchasing Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) discounts.

Some helpful reminders:

- Make use of free trials
- Do not jump the gun especially if you are still having doubts
- Beware of FOMO
- Sleep over the matter

One indicator that I made the right choice is the absence of anxiety.

Happy note-taking!
