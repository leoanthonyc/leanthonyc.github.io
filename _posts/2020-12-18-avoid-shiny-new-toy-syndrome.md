I recently bought a Macbook Pro Early 2020 in September, two months before the M1 MacBooks became available. Needless to say, I was having regrets. Every posts, videos and tweets about the new M1 I see on the web just made the situation worse.

To fix this, I unfollowed subreddits and tech reviewers in Youtube, I also hid all M1 vids in my YouTube recommendation.

I stopped thinking about it. The marketing guys in Apple are very clever and they’re doing a good job in convincing me to buy their new product. I just have to resist. Sooner or later the hype will fade, the urge weakens and I’ll get through just fine.
