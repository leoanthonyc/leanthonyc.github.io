title: N+1 fix fail
layout: post
---

I started a new freelance job this month.
I am always excited to see Rails code written by other devs.
There were a lot of issues to look out for and the N+1 is first among them.

After closing some small tickets, I fixed one N+1 issue and deployed it.
It was not until a few days later that I noticed something wrong.
The memory usage in the live site has reached the limit (500mb).
Before my _"fix"_, memory usage hovers around 300-400mb.

Why the sudden high memory usage?
It turned out that the affected resource is requested every second by unknown sources from the web (bots?).
The main model is like a calendar event which has a lot of associations (event->attendees->users->avatar) that I preloaded and the request can even have a `start_date` parameter which when set to an earlier date, i.e. 2001-01-01, will preload everything!
This explains the high memory usage.

In the end I reverted my N+1 fix. 

Lesson learned: benchmark before and after a performance fix
