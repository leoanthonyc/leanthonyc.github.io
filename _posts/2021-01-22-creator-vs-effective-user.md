title: Creator vs Effective User

Had this thought today about how I am currently ineffective in creating things that are of value to other people, myself included. All I did so far is create unfinished clones of well-established apps (YNAB and Twitter).

I plan to continue finding new ideas and create useful things. In the mean time, I should re-think about how I use existing products and tools. This might be the key in achieving my plans.
